- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.    
   I used stack overflow for help with the label and the websites provided in the tutorial to change the colors in the CSS file,

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)    
  One challenge that I encountered in the tutorial was understanding how the css, html, and javascript files were all connected. 
   I have mainly been doing back-end coding so I have not had to use css and html files. This project helped me understand how all the f
   iles are dependent on each other and each file has its own specific functions. I did not really struggle at any other stage of the tutorial. 
   The steps were easy to follow and the descriptions helped me understand how the different files are utilized to create the final project. 
   I attempted several of the optional features and struggled on some of them. Specifically, I tried the second optional feature which was
   speeding up the clue playback each turn but was not really able to figure out where my code was going wrong. I tried debugging the code with the console, unfortunately I did not have enough time to figure out where the error was. If I had more time, I would have tried to figure out the problem by debugging the code. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)  
  I do not have much experience with web development and the design side of coding. I have mainly focused on back end code in my classes. 
    Therefore, I am very curious about how the front end process works and the steps taken to design a website to be efficient and beautiful. 
    I would like to ask about what the most efficient way to approach a project is. Specifically, I would like to ask about how the workflow would work, 
    would you start from the design (CSS/HTML) and then proceed to the function (javascript file) or would you work on both the front end and back end simultaneously? 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)  
 If I had more time to work on this project, I would spend it on trying to understand CSS and HTML better. I am not familiar with these languages so I did not really change much design wise on my project. 
   I would have spent that time on the optional feature to add pictures and sounds to the project. I think that CSS and HTML are relatively easy to learn so I will use my time to learn how to use them effectively. 
   Additionally, I was unable to figure out how to speed up the time for the guesses so I would spend my extra time figuring that out as well. Speeding up the time was a feature I tried to implement but I was unable to 
   figure out what was going wrong so I ultimately decided to delete it from the code. Overall, if I had additional time I would have tried to understand CSS and HTML to make the project look better and to add in more of 
   the optional features.
